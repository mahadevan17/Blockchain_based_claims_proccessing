<h2>GREETINGS,</h2>  

<p>This project focuses on <b>Detecting fraudulent patient insurance claims</b> through <b>Machine Learning algorithms</b> and securely <b>Storing them on a blockchain</b>.</p>  

<p>Traditional insurance claim systems are plagued by <b>loopholes, corruption, and security vulnerabilities</b>. This project aims to design a system capable of withstanding <b>fraud, tampering, and cyberattacks</b>, while ensuring reliability and availability even under high demand.</p>  

<p>Compared to existing solutions, this approach stands out for its strong emphasis on <b>transparency, scalability, and patient privacy protection</b>.</p>
